/**
 * @file DekiParticlesModule.h
 * @brief Central header for the Deki Particles Module
 *
 * Particle system driven by a graph asset. The emitter holds a fixed-size
 * particle pool and is rendered as a single QuadBlit; behavior (emission,
 * shape, gravity, color/size/rotation over lifetime) is authored as a chain
 * of modifier NODES in a ParticleGraph, walked once into a flat callback list
 * when the emitter starts. External modules ship new modifier types by
 * declaring a DEKI_NODE struct in a "Particles/" category and registering its
 * ParticleModifierOps — no change to this module.
