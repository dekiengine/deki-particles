/**
 * @brief Renderable particle emitter.
 *
 * Owns a fixed-size particle pool. All authoring (emission rate, spawn shape,
 * gravity, color/size/rotation curves, etc.) lives in a ParticleGraph asset:
 * an Emitter node followed by a chain of modifier nodes, wired in the order
 * they should run. The emitter walks that graph ONCE (EnsureReady) into a flat
 * list of callbacks; per particle, the cost is exactly the modifiers wired,
 * with no graph interpretation in the loop.
 *
 * One graph drives any number of emitters. The node instances holding the
 * tuning values belong to the asset and are shared; each emitter owns only the
 * small per-modifier state blobs its chain allocated.
 *
 * Units: particle positions and velocities are world metres, like every
 * other component (the graph nodes' speeds are m/s). The sprite is drawn at
 * its own pixelsPerMeter, so a particle sprite has the size its art was
 * authored at when the camera runs at the sprite's ppm, and scale 1 means
 * "as authored".
 *
 * Render path: rasterizes all alive particles into a single intermediate
 * RGB565A8 buffer at the sprite's pixel scale, sized to the tight bounding box of the
 * alive particles, and returns one QuadBlit::Source with pixelsPerMeter set
 * to the sprite's. The framework does the final blit at the emitter's world
 * transform — sort order is per-emitter, never per-particle.
 * GetContentExtents reports the same bounding box so an emitter whose
 * particles are all off screen (or clipped away) does no work at all.
 *
 * Per CLAUDE.md "NEVER USE FALLBACKS": no sprite ⇒ renders nothing, logs
 * once. No graph ⇒ no particles ever spawn. A graph naming a modifier type
 * with no registered behavior refuses to build its chain, loudly. maxParticles
 * is honored exactly.
